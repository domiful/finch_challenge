# Finch Challenge
This is a react application with an express server that handles requests to the Finch API.

- It is based on the default template project  [nano-react-app](https://github.com/nano-react-app/nano-react-app).
- I am using [ant design](https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design) for the theme.
- I am using [rjsf](https://rjsf-team.github.io/react-jsonschema-form/docs/) with an ant theme to populate the forms.

# Requirements

Node version 22

# To use first install app and server

`cd finch_challenge`— go into root of project

`npm install`— This will install necessary node modules to run client

`cd server` - go into server files inside of project

`npm install ` - This will install necessary node modules to run client


# To use application

- `cd finch_challenge/server` -- go into server dir
- `node index.js` — This will start the server with a default port of `5155`.


In a new terminal window

- `cd finch_challenge/` -- go into client dir
- `npm start` — This will spawn a development server with a default port of `5173`.

You can open the app at `localhost:5173`
